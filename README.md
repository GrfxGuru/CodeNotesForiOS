# CodeNotesForiOS
My code note program for the iPad as part of the 100 Days of Code Project. You can find details of my participation in this project [here](https://github.com/GrfxGuru/100-days-of-code).

This application is designed for coders to store notes that are code orientated. It is designed for the iPad at this time.
