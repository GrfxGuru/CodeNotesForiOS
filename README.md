# Code Notes For iPad
### by [Peter Witham][1]

Code Notes for iOS is an iPad application designed for use by software developers to keep notes. My main reason for making the source code available is to give back to the Swift and iOS development communities, as well as anyone wanting to learn iOS development by way of a working application.

### Current Features Include

- Add/Edit/Delete Notes
- A default set of programming languages
- Add custom programming languages
- Drag and Drop note support on iOS 11

Code Notes For iPad is a 100 Days of Code Project. You can find details of my participation in this [here][2].
